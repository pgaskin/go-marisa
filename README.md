Go wrapper for [marisa-trie](https://github.com/s-yata/marisa-trie) using [wazero](https://github.com/wazero/wazero).

This library supports little-endian MARISA dictionaries up to 4 GiB. On 32-bit systems, the size is limited to 2 GiB. Big-endian dictionaries (i.e., ones generated with the native tools on big-endian hosts) are not supported.

On platforms which support wazero's JIT compiler (windows/darwin/linux arm64/amd64), it's about 2-3x slower than the native library. Using the interpreter, it's about 70-150x slower. The memory usage should be around the same, but note that keys are copied to/from Go strings when used.

<!--
In the future, I might consider adding support for CGO-based bindings on 32/64-bit little-endian systems using a build tag.
-->

Memory-mapped dictionaries are supported on unix-like platforms.

The wasm blob is fully reproducible and [verified](https://github.com/pgaskin/go-marisa/attestations).

The API is stable, type-safe, idiomatic, and does not leak implementation details of the marisa-trie library. All errors are handled appropriately and returned. Concurrent usage is not currently supported.

The MARISA dictionaries written by this wrapper will be bit-identical to the ones generated by the native marisa-build.

This module also includes drop-in replacements for the native command-line tools. The have compatible input/output and exit codes, but the error messages may differ.

There are comprehensive unit tests for most functionality.
